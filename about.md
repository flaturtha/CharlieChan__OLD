<h1>Every day, another murder mystery novel disappears!</h1>
<span>Without notice or fan fair,</span> a thrilling story fades into the darkness, giving up its life, never to be read again. A shrewd detective and dastardly killers shuffle off to permanent retirement. Simply forgotten on bookshelves -- or worse, thrown out , because theyâ€™re just too old, too worn and too forgotten.

Tales of Murder Press seeks to remedy this by republishing these amazing murder mystery stories as ebooks and new paperback editions. 

We believe that by reproducing these books, we can introduce them to a new generation of readers and enable longtime fans to rediscover murder mystery novels by Ben Benson, Hellen Reilly, Cleve F. Adams, Matthew Blood, and more. By preserving these murder mysteries, we can keep the stories, their characters and their authors alive!

You can help Tales of Murder Press keep these books alive by supporting our preservation efforts as readers and devoted fans. No major investment. No need to waste your time searching used bookstores and yard sales. Just become a fan of Tales of Murder Press by liking our Facebook page, following us on Twitter and Google+. And by seeking out our books at your favorite bookseller.
