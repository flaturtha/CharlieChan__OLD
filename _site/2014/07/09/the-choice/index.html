<p>He hesitatingly walked up the broad stone steps. He was not yet used to the silent dignity of the hospital atmosphere. </p>

<p>Inside he took off his soft hat, crushed it in his hand, and instinctively softened his footfalls as he stepped to the information desk. </p>

<p>“Mrs.—el—Follis?” </p>

<p>The girl silently plugged in the switchboard. A question, an answer: </p>

<p>“Corridor B, room 8. They are waiting for you,” she said. </p>

<p>Softly, almost on tiptoe, he walked down the long corridor, passing a nurse in the light blue, white trimmed, uniform distinctive of the hospital, turned to the right, and lightly tapped at a door on which the figure “8” appeared. </p>

<p>A nurse opened the door, looked at him, turned and beckoned to someone in the room. </p>

<p>A physician, young, alert, came to the door, glanced at him a moment, came out and closed the door behind him. </p>

<p>The man before him nervously moistened his lips. </p>

<p>The physician looked at him keenly. The man’s eyes returned the look questioningly. </p>

<p>“The time’s almost here,” said the physician. “It’s serious—the mother, or the baby. I’ve told her. She says to speak to you.” </p>

<p>A lightning expression passed over the man’s face. The physician’s boring gaze noted, but did not fathom it. </p>

<p>“May I see her?” </p>

<p>“Yes—but only for a minute.” The physician turned and opened the door. The man advanced haltingly in the semi-darkness to the bedside. </p>

<p>“John!” and two weak arms reached up and clasped him around the neck. </p>

<p>“The doctor says—” her voice choked “the doctor says,” she whispered in weak tones in his ear, “that it is baby— or me.” </p>

<p>A flash of pain winced her face, and she paused as it took her breath. </p>

<p>In a moment: </p>

<p>“I told him I’d leave it to you,” she whispered as it passed. </p>

<p>“My brave girl! My brave girl! I want you—of course I want you,” he answered, low voiced, but vibrant. </p>

<p>A look of ineffable joy came over her face. </p>

<p>“He wants me!” she said feebly, bright-eyed, joy-flushed, to the physician standing at the bedside. “He’s come back at last—and he wants me!” </p>

<p>A spasm of pain convulsed her. </p>

<p>The physician leaned over quickly, and turned to the table of instruments at his side. </p>

<p>The nurse gently took the man’s arm and led him to the door. Even in her pain the woman’s eyes lovingly followed him. </p>

<p>The door closed. A moment passed. It opened again, and the man’s head appeared inside. </p>

<p>“Doctor!” he whispered softly. </p>

<p>The physician turned, looked, walked to the door. The man beckoned silently, and the physician went outside, closing the door quietly behind him. </p>

<p>“Well?” he questioned. </p>

<p>“Save the baby,” the man replied. </p>

<p>The physician stared at him . . . turned and re-entered the room.  </p>
